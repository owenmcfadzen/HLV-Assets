## Five-Pillar Environmental Strategy

### 1. Recycled & Renewable Materials
- **Approach:** Sourcing materials from recycled/renewable sources reduces carbon footprint
- **Progress:** "24% of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled or renewable sources" in 2024

### 2. Manufacturing Renewable Energy
- **Approach:** Transitioning supplier electricity to solar, wind, and renewable sources
- **Progress:** Suppliers sourced nearly 18 gigawatts of renewable energy in 2024

### 3. Lower-Emission Packaging & Shipping
- **Approach:** Prioritizing ocean, rail, ground transportation; removing plastic from packaging
- **Progress:** "All new Apple products come in paper packaging that's 100% fiber‑based"

### 4. Customer Energy Matching
- **Approach:** Matching 100% of expected customer electricity use with clean energy
- **Progress:** Investing in clean electricity projects globally

### 5. Material Recovery & Recycling
- **Approach:** Developing technologies like Daisy robot to recover critical materials
- **Progress:** Daisy now disassembles 36 iPhone models in 2024
