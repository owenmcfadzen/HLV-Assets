### Recycled Material (40% by weight)
Using recycled materials, like 65% recycled plastic in the case, reduces the need to mine new material, which avoids the carbon emissions and environmental impacts of mining.

### Renewable Electricity (40%)
Using electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar across our global supply chain — instead of fossil fuels — significantly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing Apple products.

### Package and Ship (25% more units per trip)
We designed the AirPods Pro 3 box to be smaller than previous boxes, which reduces carbon emissions from transportation because it weighs less and more units can be shipped per trip.
