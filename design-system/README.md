# HLV Design System

A comprehensive design system for Hudson Lab Ventures, built on principles extracted from Apple's design language and adapted for educational materials.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) | AI operations guide — start here for Claude integration |
| [philosophy.md](philosophy.md) | Why and for whom — the binding strategy document |
| [decision-framework.md](decision-framework.md) | When to use what — navigation for design choices |
| [components.md](components.md) | What patterns exist — reusable component catalog |
| [typography.md](typography.md) | How type works — scale, weights, techniques |
| [layout.md](layout.md) | How space works — grid, spacing, containers |

## Quick Start

1. **For AI/Claude**: Read `SKILL.md` first — it's the orchestration layer
2. **For humans**: Read `philosophy.md` first — it explains the "why"
3. **When designing**: Start with `decision-framework.md` to navigate choices
4. **For implementation**: Reference `components.md`, `typography.md`, `layout.md`

## Core Principles

- **Confident minimalism** — Every element earns its place
- **8px grid** — All spacing in multiples of 8
- **Weight transitions** — Bold claim + regular continuation
- **Restraint** — No decoration, no competing hierarchies
